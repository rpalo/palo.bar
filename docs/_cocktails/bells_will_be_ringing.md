- 1 oz dark rum
- 1 oz apple brandy
- 1/4 oz amaretto
- 1/2 oz cherry liqueur
- 1 oz pineapple syrup
- 1/4 oz ginger juice
- 1/2 oz lemon juice
- 1 oz earl grey tea
- 3 oz hot water

Stir into a warmed mug. Garnish with a lemon twist.

**Pineapple syrup:**

2:1 sugar to water.  Cube a small pineapple for 2 cups water (which is a LOT).
Add pineapple, cover, and let sit for 24 hours.  Remove chunks and juice them
lightly adding that to the mixture.  Stir to dissolve any remaining solids
and strain into a bottle through cheese cloth.  Add a small dash of any
80+ proof neutral spirit to preserve.
