title: Black Rose
spirits:
  - bourbon
description: >-
  Bourbon sweetened by grenadine and accented with a couple dashes of Peychaud's.  A great transitioner from Old Fashioned's to Manhattan's.  Tastes very similar, but without the full flavor profile and bitter hints of sweet vermouth.

- 2 oz bourbon
- 1/4 oz grenadine
