- 3 slices of lime
- 2 dashes of Angostura bitters
- 1/4 oz demarara syrup
- 2 oz rum

Add lime slices, syrup, and bitters to a rocks glass.  Muddle lightly.  Super lightly.  Too much lime will crush your dreams.  Lime town.  Limapalooza.  Just press enough to press some oils out.

Top with the rum, add an ice cube, and stir to mix and dilute.
