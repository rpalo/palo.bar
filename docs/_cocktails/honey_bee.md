- 2 oz tequila (prefer reposado)
- 1 oz honey syrup
- 1/3 oz mezcal if available
- 3/4 oz lemon juice
- 2 dash Angostura bitters 

Rinse a highball with mezcal, then add ice.  Add tequila, honey syrup,
and lemon juice to a shaker with ice.  Shake and strain into the highball.  Garnish with a lemon curl
or wheel and top with a couple dashes of bitters.

Trust me, don't skip the bitters!
